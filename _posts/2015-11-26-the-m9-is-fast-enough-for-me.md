I am using a Leica M9 for my photography. Yes it is already a camera with a digital sensor but it is still to a large extend a manual user interface. I need to focus manually and I typically even define exposure myself.

In a world where almost everything is automatic this seems to be old-fashioned and needlessly cumbersome. Well, if you are shooting photos just for the sake of giving all control to a machine - that might be true. If you are in search of your personal touch, the way you think a photo should look like, you'd better switch of the automatic stuff.

By the way: It is completely fine if you capture stuff with the camera in your smartphone. I do that most of the time.

But there is a different mode that requires me to think and apply a tool in the very moment. The way of interacting with your tool is part of that moment.
